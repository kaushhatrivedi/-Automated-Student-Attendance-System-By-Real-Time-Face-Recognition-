 <br />
 <h2>Detection</h2>
 Detection is done by the help of OpenCV and Haar cascades
<br />
 <br />
 
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.
 <br />
 <br />
 
<h2>Recognition</h2>
 Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
<br />
 <br />
 
LBPH is one of the easiest face recognition algorithms. It can represent local features in the images. It is possible to get great results (mainly in a controlled environment). It is robust against monotonic gray scale transformations. It is provided by the OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library).
  <br />
 <br />
 
 <h2>Updating record in Excel</h2>
After the face recognition the code will automatically create an entry of the the student into the excel file .
